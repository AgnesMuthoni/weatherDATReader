===========================ASSUMPTIONS MADE===========================

The below assumptions have been made during development of this program:

		1. User may run program from any operating system, thus cater for diverse file system properties.
		2. If the .dat file is changed, the new file(with different values) will have the same name, weather.dat.
		3. The .dat file will be saved in the project's root directory.
		4. The special character * (superscript on MxT and MnT eg: 97*, 32*) can be replaced with other special characters 
		5. The special character eg: * can only be included in the MxT and MnT columns of the .dat file data.
		6. The Java version used is Java 7 and above (for any development/ Builds on the IDE).
		7. The program's runnable WeatherDATReader.jar file remains in the dist folder of the project's root directory, with the name WeatherDATReader.jar.
		8. The executable WeatherDATReader.bat/WeatherDATReader.sh file remains in the project's root directory.
